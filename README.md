## 🛠️ 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤:
Fetch campaign data from 𝐅𝐚𝐜𝐞𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤 𝐀𝐝𝐬 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐫 into 𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐠𝐥𝐞 𝐒𝐡𝐞𝐞𝐭𝐬 📤
Integrate the data with a 𝐁𝐈 𝐭𝐨𝐨𝐥 to create an intuitive, visually appealing dashboard 📈

1️⃣ I used 𝐌𝐚𝐤𝐞.𝐜𝐨𝐦 (an AI-driven automation tool) to fetch the data seamlessly.
2️⃣ Integrated the data into 𝐋𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐢𝐨, where I designed a clean and interactive dashboard.

## 💡 𝐀 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭:
To calculate ROAS, I fetched revenue data via the Stripe API, aligned it with ad spend, and used a formula to provide actionable insights for the campaigns.
